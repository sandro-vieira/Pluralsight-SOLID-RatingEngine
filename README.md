SOLID principles for C# Developers

The main purpose of this repository is to reproduce the sample used on the course SOLID Principles for C# Developers by Steve Smith at https://www.pluralsight.com

For a better understanding of the Principles I strongly recommend to watch the course.
 
For my own practice I decided to start the base code on the main, and apply each principle in separated branches. In the end of the day it will be possible to compare a code with/without SOLID principles applied to it.
